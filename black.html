        Any <s>fool</s> can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
        But code is human language. It has to communicate the who, what, when, where, how, and why of a task, as well as instruct the computer. 
        It has to make sense five years from now after the company has been acquired and a new team who has never seen 
        this code before has to crack it open and make an enhancement or fix a bug.
